					Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a broad-spectrum disorder, covering fatty liver, cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis and in extreme untreated condition hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may also develop. Cladonia rangiferina (CR) is a class of lichen having a broad spectrum of pharmacological activity. It is used like traditional natural sources in ancient times in India, China, Sri Lanka, etc. Folkloric record about CR has reported their use as an antimicrobial, antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities, etc. Hence, the present study was requested to ascertain the effect of the ethanolic extract of Cladonia rangiferina (CRE) on alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity. The animals were evaluated for the estimation of the liver in vivo biochemical antioxidant parameters. The liver tissues were further evaluated histopathologically and western blotting examination for localization of apoptotic gene expression that plays a pivotal role in hepatotoxicity. The results of this study reveal that CRE proves to be helpful in the treatment of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress. Results of different markers have shown that among all, CRE has demonstrated the best hepatoprotective activity. These observations say about the importance of the components of the extract. The ameliorative action of CRE in alcoholic liver damage may exist due to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities.				</div>

				The pyrethroid toxicants are found as remnants of agricultural crops pesticides and as ingredients of commercially available insecticides. The present work demonstrates the toxic effects of the high-contents pyrethroids available in different insecticidal products and studies the protective effects of ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol through histopathological observations of the damages to the affected tissues of liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain. The ascorbic acid showed complete recovery as comparable to the control groups for liver and heart's tissue damages, while α-tocopherol was very effective in significantly ameliorating the damages in kidneys, lungs, and the brain tissues of the experimental animals when compared with the control groups in their respective set of experiments. The high levels of tissue damages recovery by the ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol suggests their prophylactic use for subjects under the exposure of pyrethrins.

				The current study proposed the in vivo antidepressant and anxiolytic activities of the aqueous extract from Solanum melongena fruits (AESM) in mice. The mice were administered with AESM 100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o. for anxiolytic (elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and locomotor action), and antidepressant (forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) activities. The possible mechanism of action of Solanum melongena fruits was also analyzed by measuring the level of serotonin (5HT), monoamine oxidase enzyme (MAO-A) and GABA activity in the blood of experimental animals. When mice were treated for seven days with 100 (*** P < 0.01) and 200 mg / kg, AESM p.o. and 2 mg / kg, diazepam p.o. (*** P < 0.001) showed significant increases in the average time expended and the number of entries into the open arms of the EPMT, as compared to control group in dose dependent fashion. However, when mice were treated with standard Imipramine (10 mg/kg) (***P < 0.001), AESM 100 mg/kg (**P < 0.01) and 200 mg/kg (*P < 0.05) after day 7, there was significant reduction in locomotor activity in both TST and FST in dose dependent fashion. Monoamine oxidase - A level in the entire brain of mice were significantly reduced when pretreated with AESM 100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o. for 7 days as compared to control group in dose dependent fashion. The mechanisms of action of antidepressant effect of Solanum melongena fruits extract act by increasing serotonin and also GABA. Moreover, the extract also decreased the MAO-A enzyme in the experimental animals. These results demonstrated that both of these doses. Of aqueous extract from Solanum melongena fruits possess potential antidepressant activities in dose dependent fashion.

In this study, some new essential amino acid-benzofuran-acetamide/propanamide/butanamide hybrid derivatives were synthesized. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of their elemental and spectral analyses. Their anti-seizure activity was investigated using maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous metrazol (scMET) seizure tests in mice. Neurotoxicity (NT) of the synthesized compounds was also determined by the rotarod test. Derivatives exhibited favorable protection in both MES and scMET tests with high safety levels in NT test. The derivatives have proven significant activity in mice and could be suggested as potential anticonvulsant lead compounds. All leucine-chlorobenzoyl benzofuran-acetamide/propanamide/ butanamide hybrid derivatives (7b, 7b, and 8b) showed significant anticonvulsant activity in MES model. Compound 8b also demonstrated potent anticonvulsant activity against scMET test. The compound 8b showed maximum activity and would be considered as a lead for further optimization as anticonvulsant agent.				</div>

Traditional pertinence: Argyreia speciosa Sweet (Linn.), belongs to the family convolvulaceae, a traditional Indian medicinal herb, has been used to treat acute/chronic ulcers, gonorrhea, rheumatoid arthritis and several nervous disorders having a long history. Aim of the study: A broad spectrum approach of this work was to find out the antioxidant activity of Argyreia speciosa seeds, in vitro and in vivo antioxidant assay were performed. Material and methods: Total phenolic content (TPC), reducing power (RP), antioxidant activity (AOA), O 2 · - (superoxide anion), DPPḢ (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ˙OH (hydroxyl) radicals scavenging activities, GSH (glutathione), CAT (catalase), SOD (superoxide dismutase) and LPO (lipid peroxidase) are the major parameters which were studied for determining in vitro and in vivo antioxidant property of seed extract & their six fractions obtained from A. speciosa. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced rat model was used to determine in vivo antioxidant assay of extract and its fractions. Results: Butanol fraction (AS-BF) showed strong antioxidant property and protected oxidative DNA damage. AS-BF was found best as compared to all other fraction for determining antioxidant property of seeds with the reduction in lipid peroxide formation and increment in GSH, CAT and SOD. AS-BF showed the presence of phenolic compounds viz. gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid. Conclusion: From these results, it was proved that A. speciosa seeds prevent tissue damage due to oxidative stress with strong antioxidant activity.

Free radicals are the byproducts of physiological aerobic cellular metabolism. Intrinsic antioxidant system plays its pivotal function in prevention of any loss due to free radicals. Though, incorporation or excess production of free radicals from environment to living system or imbalanced defense mechanism of antioxidant system leads to severe consequences like neuro-degeneration. Sensory or functional loss occurs in neural cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Besides numerous other genetic or environmental factors, oxidative stress is the major cause which leads to damage of neurons and production of neurodegenative diseases. However, oxygen is vital for existence, excessive reactive oxygen species production and imbalanced metabolism leads to a variety of diseases such as aging, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and many other neurodegenative diseases. Free radicals toxicity contributes to DNA and proteins damage, tissue damage, inflammation and consequent cellular apoptosis. Neuroprotection is a broad term commonly used to refer therapeutic strategies that can prevent, delay or even reverse neuronal damage. Since thousands of years, lots of medicinal plants have been used in a group of herbal preparations of Ayurveda (Indian traditional health care system) named Rasayana because of the antioxidant principles present in it, responsible for their medicinal use in neurodegenerative diseases. This work constitutes a literature review on natural products contain antioxidant principles used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Wound healing is a complex process in which injured skin and tissues repaired by interaction of a complex cascade of cellular events that generates resurfacing, reconstitution and restoration of the tensile strength of injured skin. It follows β-catenin, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways. Aegle marmelos L., generally known as bael is found to act as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-ulcer agent. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that this Indian traditional medicinal plant, A. marmelos flower extract (AMF) was used for wound injury. Henceforth, the current study was investigated to ascertain the effect of its active constituents in vitro wound healing with mechanism involve in migration of cells and activation of β-catenin in keratinocytes, inhibition of PGE2 in macrophages and production of collagen in fibroblasts. We have taken full thickness wound of rats and applied AMF for 2 weeks. Cutaneous wound healing activity was performed using HaCaT keratinocytes, Hs68 dermal fibroblasts and RAW264.7 macrophages to determine cell viability, nitric oxide production, collagen expression, cell migration and β-catenin activation. Results shows that AMF treated rats demonstrated reduced wound size and epithelisation was improved, involved in keratinocytes migration by regulation of Akt signaling, beta-catenin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. AMF and its active constituent's increased mRNA expression, inhibited nitric oxide, PGE2 release, mRNA expression of mediators in RAW 264.7 macrophages and enhances the motility of HaCaT keratinocytes in vitro wound healing of rats.				</div>

				The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the toxicities of different 
				types of mosquito repellents i.e. coils, mats and liquid vapors in animal models. Different types of
				 mosquito repellents including liquid vaporizers, coils and mats have been extensively used by the 
				 people to get protection from the mosquitoes and diseases associated with them. The active constituents 
				 of these repellents include; allethrins, pyrethrins, paraffin and various other derivatives, are well known
				 for their toxicities. Exposure of albino mice to these repellents for 3 h per day over a period of 20 days
				 produced significant toxicological effects on vital body organs including; liver, lungs, kidneys, brain and heart. 
				 The order of toxicity of different repellents on nervous and hepatic tissues was found to be: Coil > Liquid > Mat while 
				 
				 in renal and cardiac tissues, the coil was again found to be the most toxic one, mat with medium toxicity whereas liquid as 
				 least toxic (Coil > Mat > liquid). Lungs tissues are almost equally affected by all the repellants. On the basis of current findings,
					 it has been concluded that exposure to various types of mosquito repellents can be deleterious to health and can cause various health 
					 related issues by producing pathological changes in the vital organs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of methanolic extract of Cinnamomum camphora leaves (MECC) in albino wistar rats against maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) models. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress parameters like malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were estimated in the brains after completion of the anticonvulsant studies. MECC (50 and 120 mg/kg b.w., p.o.) exhibited anticonvulsant activity as indicated by significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) reduction in the duration of hind limb tonic extensor phase in MES induced seizure model and significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) increased the time of onset of clonic convulsion, decreased the duration of seizures, increased the % protection and decreased the percent mortality in a dose dependent manner. MECC (50 and 120 mg/kg b.w., p.o.) exhibited neuroprotective activity as indicated by significant reduction in MDA levels, AChE activity and increased GSH level also in a dose dependent manner. These results indicate that MECC may exert anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects which may be attributed to the increase in the level of GABA, inhibition of AChE and inflammation and antioxidant activity in the brain.			  </div>

				Background: Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) over expression is responsible for carcinogenesis by promoting epigenetic silence of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, HDAC1 inhibitors has came out as the potential therapeutic leads against multiple human cancers, as they can block the activity of particular HDACs, renovate the expression of several tumour suppressor genes and bring about cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Methods: The present research work comprises of atom-based 3D-QSAR, docking, molecular dynamic simulations and DFT (density functional theory) studies on a diverse series of hydroxamic acid derivatives as selective HDAC1 inhibitors. Two pharmacophoric models were generated and validated by calculating the enrichment factors with the help of decoy set. The Four different 3D-QSAR models i.e., PLS (partial least square) model, MLR (multiple linear regression) model, Field based model and GFA (Genetic function approximation) model were developed using 'PHASE' v3.4 (Schrödinger) and Discovery Studio (DS) 4.1 software and validated using different statistical parameters like internal and external validation. Results & discussion: The results showed that the best PLS model has R2=0.991 and Q2=0.787, the best MLR model has R2= 0.993 and Q2= 0.893, the best Field based model has R2= 0.974 and Q2= 0.782 and the best GFA model has R2= 0.868 and Q2= 0.782. Cross-validated coefficient, (rcv2) of 0.967, 0.926, 0.966 and 0.829 was found for PLS model, MLR, Field based and GFA model, respectively indicating the satisfied correlativity and prediction. The docking studies were accomplished to find out the conformations of the molecules and their essential binding interactions with the target protein. The trustworthiness of the docking results was further confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies. Density Functional Theory (DFT) study was performed which promptly optimizes the geometry, stability and reactivity of the molecule during receptor ligand interaction. Thus, present research work provides spatial fingerprints which would be beneficial for the development of potent HDAC1 inhibitors.

				Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have demonstrated as an emerging class of anticancer drugs involved in regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling thus indicating valid targets for different types of cancer therapeutics. The pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (Farydac®, LBH589) is developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and a newly US FDA approved drug for the multiple myeloma. It is under clinical investigation for a range of hematological and solid tumors worldwide in both oral and intravenous formulations. Panobinostat inhibits tumor cell growth by interacting with acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins as well as various apoptotic, autophagy-mediated targets and various tumorigenesis pathways involved in the development of cancer. The current article summarizes the status of panobinostat in gastrointestinal cancers. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that panobinostat has potential inhibitory activity in hepatocellular, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Clinical evaluations of panobinostat are currently underway. Herein, we have also reviewed the rationale behind the combination therapy under the trials and possible future prospective for the treatment of GI tumors.

				Total extracts of Drechslera rostrata and Eurotium tonophilum in addition of two isolated compounds from their cultures [di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (H1) and 1,8-Dihydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone (H2)] were tested for their antitumor activity using four human carcinoma cell lines. Antitumor activity was assessed by performing MTT assay to check the % cell viability. The % viability of HCT-116 (colon carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HEp-2 (larynx carcinoma) and HepG-2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells decreased after treatment with Drechslera rostrata and Eurotium tonophilum extracts, these effects were ranged from 059.0± 0.1 to 217.0 ± 0.3 μg/ml on all types of cancer cells. The best activity was recorded for Eurotium tonpholium extract (054.5 ± 0.3, 059.0 ± 0.5 and 059.0 ± 0.1 for HEp-2, Hela, and HepG-2 respectively). The isolated compounds (H1&H2) were found to be responsible about the activities because they recorded the lowest IC50 on tested cell lines with range of 9.5-20.3 μg/ml. Vinblastine sulphate was used as a reference standard and showed in vitro anticancer activity. This study demonstrated that all extracts and isolated compounds have antitumor activity against HCT-116, HeLa, HEp-2 and HepG-2 cells.

				ABSTRACT: To study the  analgesic and antipyretic activities of ethanolic extract of Bambusa arundinacea leaves (EEBA) in rats by using models tail immersion test, hot  plate  test  and  brewer’s  yeast  pyrexia  model.  Methods:  The  dried powdered leaves  were  extracted  with  ethanol  and  the  resultant  extract  was  subjected  for phytochemical  investigation  to  identify  different  phytoconstituents.  Analgesic activity of the ethanolic extract of B. arundinacea leaves at a dose of 100mg/kg b.w., p.o. and  200mg/kg b.w., p.o. were evaluated against  the standard drug  Diclofenac sodium at a  dose of 10mg/kg  b.w., i.p. by tail  immersion  test and hot  plate test. Antipyretic activity of  EEBA (100  mg/kg and  200 mg/kg)  was assessed  by using brewer’s  yeast  pyrexia  model  in rats  against  the standard  drug Paracetamol (150 mg/kg,  p.o.). Results:  Preliminary  phytochemical  investigations  showed  the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids, tannins  and  phenolic  compounds  as  major  secondary  metabolites.  The  results showed that in tail immersion and hot plate test, EEBA has shown significant (P < 0.05) increase in the latency period at both high and low doses indicating analgesic activity. EEBA (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) also significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia in rats. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of Bambusa arundinaceae leaves exhibited significant analgesic and antipyretic activities at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg in dose dependent manner.

				Aim: To evaluate the antihypertensive effect of ethanolic extract of seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris Linn. (EEPV) on high salt diet induced hypertension in male rats. Methods: Male wistar rats (180-200g) received high salt diet (8% NaCl) and 1% saline water for 6 weeks, then cannulated for dosing of Enalapril, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in standard group and EEPV (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.v.) in test group and measured mean blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate with the help of Power Lab 6 Pro after 60 minutes of treatment. Results: Elevated blood pressure of the animals was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased by EEPV (100 mg/kg, i.v). Enalapril, at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, i.v. showed significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the elevated blood pressure. The antihypertensive activity of ethanolic extract of seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris Linn. may be due to the action on rennin-angiotensin system. The antihypertensive activity of EEPV might also be explained by the presence of phytochemical constituents like flavanoids and saponins in the plant. Conclusion: The work demonstrated that the concomitant administration of high-salt and EEPV elicits prevention of high salt-induced hypertension in rats. Overall, results justify and support the use of Phaseolus vulgaris Linn. as antihypertensive medicine.

				Infertility refers to the biological inability of an individual to contribute to conception over the course of one year. Male infertility refers to a male’s incapability to cause pregnancy in a fertile female. Approximately 15% of couples are affected by infertility and among them 40–50% cases are attributed to male infertility. Male infertility is mainly categorized into Azoospermia (AS) and Coital infertility (CI). Many studies have supported that different factors such as varicocele, testicular failure, endocrine dysfunction, genital tract infection, testicular disturbances, testicular cancer, hormonal disturbances, retrograde ejaculation, prolonged exposure to heat, obesity, older age, smoking, alcohol, heavy metals, pesticides, oxidative stress, genetic factors and different environmental and nutritional factors reversibly or irreversibly influence male fertility. Male infertility can be diagnosed by different tools. Diagnosing male infertility problems usually involves physical examination, semen analysis, hormone tests, testicular biopsy, urine test etc. There are different pharmacological, non-pharmacological, combination and ethno-pharmacological treatment options for male infertility. The infertility of known etiology has considerable treatment success rate. However, genetic or idiopathic male infertility has optimized and empirical approach. This review summarizes classification, causes, diagnosis and treatment of male infertility. The article is based on English peer-reviewed articles located on Scopus, Pubmed, ScienceDirect etc.

				ABSTRACT: Aim: The present  study provides a  scientific evaluation for the wound healing activity of methanolic extract of Ziziphus xylopyrus (Retz) Willd leaves (MEZX). Methods: Incision and excision wound models were used to evaluate the wound healing activity of MEZX on Wistar rats. In each model, animals  were divided  into four  groups of 6  animals each.  In both model, Group  I was assigned as control (ointment base).  Group II and  III were  treated  with  5%w/w  and  10%  w/w  MEZX  topical  ointment respectively.  Group  IV was  treated  with  standard nitrofurazone  ointment (0.2% w/w). The parameters recorded were percentage of wound contraction, epithelialisation period and  tensile strength. Results: It was noted that the effect produced by MEZX ointment showed significant (P < 0.001) healing in all wound models when compared with the control group. All parameters such  as  wound  contraction,  epithelialisation  period  and  tensile  strength showed significant (P  < 0.001)  changes when  compared  with the control. MEZX stimulates wound contraction, decreases epithelialisation period and increases  tensile  strength.  Conclusion:  This  study  suggests  that  MEZX possesses wound healing activity against Incision and excision wound.

				In chemotherapy for tuberculosis, leprosy, cancer and stress conditions the immune system are impaired and suppressed. In such situations the effect of adaptogenic phytoconstituents are essential for healthy blood to support optimal oxygen carrying capacity which is important for stamina. The aim of this review is to bring together most of the available scientific research related to adaptogens, those are plant-derived biologically active substances. Adaptogens are the substances that appear to induce a state of non-specific increase of resistance of the organism to diverse assaults that threaten internal homeostasis and improve physical endurance. Supplementation with various plant materials which are the source of vitamins, acids, minerals and other phytoconstituents has been evaluated for their adaptogenic activity during exposure to a stressful environment. This review has been compiled using references from major databases such as Chemical Abstracts, Science Direct, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Abstracts, SciFinder, PubMed, Dr. Duke′s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases. Nature is a rich source of biological and chemical diversity and a number of plants in the world have been used in traditional medicine remedies. This work constitutes a literature review on medicinal plants with its chemical constituents showing adaptogenic properties. Various medicinal plants with its phytochemical constituentsareshowing adaptogenic properties and it is used during chemotherapy in which the immune system are impaired and suppressed.

				Background and Objective: The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of polyherbal formulation Rumalaya Forte on experimentally induced insulin resistant myocardial infarction in rats. Materials and Methods: The effect of polyherbal formulation Rumalaya Forte (160 and 320 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o.) was studied on the high fat diet induced insulin resistant myocardial infarction animal model. Vitamin E (100 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o.) was used as standard. The study was evaluated with the help of various biochemical parameters and histopathological examination. Results: Results showed that the Rumalaya Forte treatment prevented myocardial infarction,increase in blood glucose level,body weight and weight gain due to antioxidant property and showed a significant dose dependent decrease in the parameters like alanine aminotransferase,aspartate aminotransferase,creatinine phosphokinase,total cholesterol,total triglycerides,weight and number of adipocytes and in infarction size. The histopathological examination also reveals the significant protection in the Rumalaya Forte treated group with a minimal or no red coloration in a dose dependent manner. Rumalaya Forte 160 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o. groups showed relatively less disruption of myofibers with Rumalaya Forte 320 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o. and vitamin E showing maximum fiber integrity. Rumalaya Forte 320 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o. was found to be more effective compared to Rumalaya Forte 160 mg kg⁻¹ b.wt.,p.o. Conclusion: The pleiotropic effect of Rumalaya Forte can be utilized as add on therapy for treatment of myocardial infarction.

				Abstract : a native plant of Indo-Malaysia is best known for its fruits, which contain about 75 percent juicy edible pulp. The acidic pulp is a common ingredient in culinary preparations such as condiments, curries, beverages, jams in countries where the plant grows naturally. The fruit is pickled in salt solution which is rich of minerals, acids, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, flavonoids, vitamins, peptides and sugars. Ripe fruit is full of acids and micro and macro nutrients which combine well with sugars, and used to prepare a variety of jam. It is now considered as a valuable source of several unique products for the medicines against various diseases and also for the development of some industrial products. The present review includes comprehensive information on the chemical constituents , traditional uses, pharmacological actions and nutraceutical values of raw material and processed products. Karonda is relatively a new item yet to explore the full potential and a fruit that needs promotion and publicity in the international markets.

				A series of N-(2-(benzoyl/4-chlorobenzoyl)-benzofuran3-yl)-2-(substituted)-acetamide derivatives (4a-l, 5a-l)
was synthesized in good yield. All synthesized compounds were in agreement with elemental and spectral
data. The anticonvulsant activity of all synthesized compounds was assessed against the maximal electroshock
induced seizures (MES) model in mice. Neurotoxicity
was evaluated using the rotarod method. The majority of
compounds exhibited anticonvulsant activity at a dose of
30 mg kg–1 body mass during 0.5–4 h, indicating their
ability to prevent seizure spread at low doses. Relative to
phenytoin, [N-(2-(4-chlorobenzoyl)benzofuran-3-yl)-2-
(cyclohexyl(methyl)amino)-acetamide] (5i) and [N-(2-(4-
chlorobenzoyl)benzofuran-3-yl)-2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-
yl)-acetamide] (5c) demonstrated comparable relative
anticonvulsant potency of 0.74 and 0.72, respectively,
whereas [(N-(2-(4-chlorobenzoyl)benzofuran-3-yl)-2-(4-
(furan-2-carbonyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-acetamide] (5f) exhibited the lowest relative potency of 0.16. The ALD50 of
tested compounds ranged from 1.604 to 1.675 mmol kg–1
body mass. The ED50 of synthesized compounds ranged
from 0.055 to 0.259 mmol kg–1 (~23.4 to 127.6 mg kg–1) body
mass. The pharmacophore mapping of the examined
compounds on standard drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, ralitolin and carbamazepine) strongly suggests that
these compounds may exert their anticonvulsant activity
via the same established mechanism as that of known
drugs.</div>

				The present study provides a scientific assessment for the hypoglycemic effect of methanolic extract of Callicarpa macrophylla fruits (MECM) on STZ-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of STZ at a dose of 55 mg/kg body weight for 7 days. Methanolic extract of Callicarpa macrophylla fruits [100 and 200 mg/kg b.w., (p.o.)] was administered to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 14 days. The effect of MECM on blood glucose, serum lipid profile and HbA1c was studied in diabetic rats. Metformin was used as a reference hypoglycemic drug. In OGTT, oral administration of MECM (200 mg/kg b. w., P < 0.05) and metformin (11.3 mg/kg b.w., P < 0.01) showed significant decrease in the blood glucose levels at 60 min. The administration of MECM (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease (P < 0.001) in blood glucose level in STZ-induced Type 2 diabetic rats. Further MECM showed antihyperlipidemic activity as evidenced by significant decrease (P < 0.001) in serum TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C levels coupled together with elevation of HDL-C level (P < 0.001) in STZ-induced Type 2 diabetic rats. HbA1c significantly decreased with MECM (200 mg/kg b.w. and 100 mg/kg b.w., P < 0.01) in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The results suggest that the methanolic extract of Callicarpa m

				Objective: The aim of the present study was a comparative study of neuroprotective effect of telmisartan and donepezil against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mice. Methods: In this study, we investigated the comparative effect of telmisartan (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and donepezil (5 mg/kg, p.o.) in systemic inflammation induced by LPS, ibuprofen (40 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as standard. Mice were treated with a single i.c. injection of LPS (5 μg/5 μl/kg), after 7 days the animal behavior was evaluated by testing specific cognitive functions, on Morris water maze and Pole climbing test. Biochemical estimation for glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Results: The neuroprotective effect of telmisartan (5 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg) in LPS induced neuroinflammation in mice was compared. Oral administration of telmisartan (5 mg/kg) for 7 days shows a better result in Morris water maze and pole climbing test, in comparison of donepezil. It also increases the level of GSH and decreases the level of MDA and TNF-α in mice brain. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that telmisartan and donepezil reduces LPS-induced microglial activation, beta-amyloid generation, central nervous system cytokine production, and behavioral symptoms of sickness. In comparative study of telmisartan and donepezil, telmisartan shows significant decrease in escape latency time and transfer latency time in comparison of donepezil. Therefore, telmisartan is more effective as the comparative of donepezil. © 2015, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research. All Rights Reserved.

				The comparative study of neuroprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors against scopolamine-induced neuroinflammation in albino Wistar rats was studied. Male albino rats were administered with scopolamine to induce memory impairment. The standard nootropic agent, piracetam (200 mg/kg b.w., [i.p.]), perindopril (0.1 mg/kg b.w., [i.p.]), enalapril (0.1 mg/kg b.w., [i.p.]), and ramipril (0.1 mg/kg b.w., [i.p.]) were administered in different group of animals for 5 days. On 5(th) day, scopolamine (1 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) was administered after 60 min of the last dose of test drug. Memory function was evaluated in Morris water maze (MWM) test and pole climbing test (PCT). Biochemical estimations like glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain were estimated after completion of behavior study. All three test groups shows improvement in learning and memory in comparison to control group. Perindopril treated group showed a more effective significant decrease in escape latency time and transfer latency time compared to enalapril and ramipril treated group on day 4 in MWM test and PCT, respectively. Perindopril shows a significant reduction in MDA level and acetylcholinesterase activity and a significant rise in GSH level compared to enalapril and ramipril. The finding of this study indicates that Perindopril is more effective in memory retention compared to enalapril and ramipril.

				Aim: Hormone replacement therapy was considered a safe treatment for short-term therapy. But, because of adverse outcomes such as increased risk of endometrial and breast cancer, stroke and pulmonary thrombo-embolism after its long-term use, women turned to use natural health remedies. Thus, the estrogenic activity of 70% hydro-alcoholic extract of Artocarpus lakoocha fruit (HEAL) was evaluated. Materials and Methods: HEAL was subjected to phytochemical analysis as per standard protocol. Estrogenic potential of HEAL was performed by uterotropic assay, vaginal cytology and measurement of vaginal opening at different doses of 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg bw po in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and compared with standard drug β-estradiol (2 mg/kg bw, po). Ovariectomized immature and mature female SD rats were administered with HEAL for 7 days. Results: It showed the presence of tannins, saponins, triterpenes, flavonoids, steroids and alkaloids as major secondary metabolites in HEAL. Dose of 600 mg/kg administered in ovariectomized immature and mature female SD rats resulted in significant increase in the uterine wet weight of 219.60±8.71 mg and 906.19±26.91 mg respectively when compared with that of control rats of 110.55±1.16 mg and 505.66±27.38 mg respectively. Only cornified epithelial cells were seen in HEAL-treated rats at the dose of 600 mg/kg indicating the presence of estrogen. Significant vaginal opening was also seen in HEAL-treated rats at the dose of 600 mg/kg. Conclusion: It was concluded that HEAL possess promising estrogenic activity.

				Majority of the antidepressant drugs improve depressive symptoms, but they exert multiple unwanted side effects. The search for more efficacious and well tolerated drugs is in progress. Owning to this, the present study was designed to evaluate the antidepressant activity of alcoholic extract of the fruits of Osmanthus fragrans (AEFOF) in mice. It was evaluated using the Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swimming Test (FST) and influence on spontaneous locomotor activity (SLMA) in mice. The AEFOF (75 mg kg-1, peroral (po) and 150 mg kg-1, po) was administered orally in separate groups of Swiss mice for 14 days in TST and FST tests and for 7 successive days in SLMA test. The AEFOF showed a dose dependant reduction in duration of immobility in mice. The dose of 150 mg kg-1 of AEFOF significantly reduced the immobility time of mice in both FST and TST without any significance effect on locomotor activity of mice. The efficacy of extract was found to be comparable to fluoxetine (20 mg kg-1, po). It was found to be toxicologically safe with no deaths of mice when administered orally at the dose of 2000 mg kg-1. From the present study, it can be concluded that the AEFOF possess potent antidepressant activity as shown by the TST and FST tests and is toxicologically safe

				Cucurbita maxima (CM) seed oil is commonly used in Indian folk medicine to treat various ailments. We have investigated the effect of CM seed oil on memory impairment induced by scopolamine in rats. Male adult Wistar rats were administered scopolamine 1 mg/kg body weight, i.p. or 1.25 mg/kg body weight, s.c. to induce memory impairment. The nootropic agent piracetam 100 mg/kg body weight, i.p. and CM seed oil 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight, p.o. were administered daily for five consecutive days. The memory function was evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) test, the social recognition test (SRT), the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and the pole climbing test (PCT). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the brains after completion of the behavioural studies. The effects of scopolamine on the levels of the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) transcript were also investigated. Scopolamine caused memory impairment in all the behavioural paradigms along with a significant increase in the AChE activity and oxidative stress in the brain. Scopolamine also caused a significant increase in the expression of TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. CM seed oil exhibited antiamnesic activity as indicated by a significant reduction in the latency time in the MWM test and decreased social interaction during trial 2 in the SRT. Further, treatment with CM seed oil significantly decreased the AChE activity and malondialdehyde levels and increased the glutathione level in brain regions. CM seed oil also significantly decreased the expression of TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. The effect of CM seed oil on behavioural and biochemical parameters was comparable to that observed in rats treated with piracetam. These results indicate that CM seed oil may exert antiamnesic activity which may be attributed to the inhibition of AChE and inflammation as well as its antioxidant activity in the brain.

Scopolamine also caused a significant increase in the expression of TNF-α in the hippocampus. CM seed oil exhibited antiamnesic activity as indicated by a significant reduction in the latency time in the MWM test and decreased social interaction during trial 2 in the SRT. Further, treatment with CM seed oil significantly decreased the AChE activity and malondialdehyde levels and increased the glutathione level in brain regions. CM seed oil also significantly decreased the expression of TNF-α in the hippocampus. The effect of CM seed oil on behavioural and biochemical parameters was comparable to that observed in rats treated with piracetam. These results indicate that CM seed oil may exert antiamnesic activity which may be attributed to the inhibition of AChE and inflammation as well as its antioxidant activity in the brain.

				ABSTRACT: When designing small molecules to interact with the targets, oneshould  consider  stereo  selectivity.  As  considerations  for  exploring  structurespace evolve, chirality  is increasingly important. Binding  affinity for a chiraldrug  can  differ  for  diastereomers  and  between  enantiomers.  For  the  virtualscreening and  computational design stage  of  drug  development, this problemcan  be  compounded  by  incomplete  stereochemical  information  in  structurelibraries leading to a "coin toss" as to whether or not the "ideal" chiral structureis present. Creating every stereoisomer for each chiral compound in a structurelibrary leads to an exponential increase in the number of structures resulting inpotentially unmanageable file  sizes and  screening times.  Therefore, only  keychiral structures, enantiomeric pairs based on relative stereochemistry need beincluded, and lead to a compromise between exploration of chemical space andmaintaining  manageable  libraries.  In  clinical  environments,  enantiomers  ofchiral drugs can have reduced, no, or even deleterious effects. This underscoresthe  need  to  avoid  mixtures  of  compounds  and  focus  on  chiral  synthesis.Governmental  regulations  emphasizing the  need  to monitor  chirality in  drugdevelopment have increased. The United States Food and Drug Administrationissued  guidelines  and policies  in 1992  concerning the  development  of chiralcompounds. These guidelines require that absolute stereochemistry be known forcompounds with chiral centers  and that  this information should be  establishedearly in drug development in order that the analysis can  be considered valid.From exploration of structure space to governmental regulations it is clear thatthe question of chirality in drug design is of vital importance

				Objective: The present work was undertaken to investigate the effects of aqueous extract from Cinnamomum tamala leaf in experimentally induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Materials and methods: The antihyperlipidemic effect of aqueous extract from Cinnamomum tamala leaf (CTLE) was evaluated in male albino rats of Wistar strain at two graded doses levels viz. 200 and 400 mg/kg of body weight. The following two models were used for the antihyperlipidemic activity, high fat diet and Triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemia in rat. CTLE (200 mg/kg, b.w. & 400 mg/kg, b.w.) was administered orally for 28 days in high fat diet and 7 days in Triton X-100 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) induced hyperlipidemia in rat. The efficacy of CTLE was compared to Standard Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg, p.o.) in high fat diet and Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) in Triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemia. Effect of CTLE on serum lipid profile like TC, TG, HDL-C, weight gain and LDL-C, and biochemical parameters like SGOT and SGPT were estimated. Result: CTLE significantly reduced the TC, TG, LDL-C and increase the HDL-C in both high fat diet & Triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemic rats. The increase in weight in rats administered with CTLE was less when compared to rats fed with high-fat diet and Triton X-100. The levels of SGOT and SGPT have been significantly (P < 0.001) decreased by the administration of CTLE in the experimental groups. The efficacy of CTLE was found to be comparing to Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg, p.o.) in high fat diet and Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) in Triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemia. CTLE showed a significant antihyperlipidemic effect in both high fat diet and Triton X-100-induced hyperlipidemic rats in a dose-dependent manner during 28 days and 7 days of treatment period. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the CTLE has a definite antihyperlipidemic potential.

				A series of 12, N-(2-benzoylbenzofuran-3-yl)-3-(substituted)propanamide analogs was designed and synthesized to meet the pharmacophore requirement essential for anticonvulsant activity. All the compounds were characterized by IR, 1H NMR and mass spectral data followed by their anticonvulsant evaluation according to the Antiepileptic Drug Development Program (ADD) protocol. The present study has proved the hypothesis concerning the pharmacophore model with essential binding sites. N-(2-benzoylbenzofuran-3-yl)-3-(4-(2-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl) propanamide, 6h was found to be the most active compound in both maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous metrazol (scMET) seizure test at 30 and 100 mg/kg respectively at 0.5 and 4.0 h.

				Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by progressive loss of cognitive  abilities  such  as  memory,  speaking and  problem  solving. Scopolamine  model  is  based  on cholinergic  hypofunction  and  widely  used  as  experimental  model  of  memory  impairment  in  the antidementic drug development. Present study investigated the effect of ethanolic extract of Bambusa arundinacea leaves  (EEBA)  on  scopolamine induced memory impairment in  rats using Morris water maze  (MWM)  and  social  recognition  tests  (SRT).  The  results  showed  that  EEBA  prevented scopolamine induced  amnesia in  both  the  behavioural paradigms, MWM and SRT, in rats. Further, the  antiamnesic  effect  of  EEBA  was  associated  with  significant  reduction  in  oxidative  stress  and AChE activity  in rat  brain  regions.  Preventive  administration of  EEBA for  5  days  dose-dependently ameliorated scopolamine induced memory impairment in rats. In MWM test, EEBA caused significant reduction  in  latency  to  reach  hidden  platform  in  comparison  to  the  scopolamine  treated  group indicating  successful  learning.  These  results  suggested  that  the  antiamnesic  effect  of  EEBA on scopolamine  induced  memory  deficit  may  be  mediated  via  facilitation  of  the  central  cholinergic nervous system. Administration of EEBA showed dose  dependent inhibition of scopolamine induced elevation of AChE activity. The inhibition of AChE by EEBA could lead to increased ACh level in brain which may be responsible for its antiamnesic effect. The standard drug piracetam also reduced AChE activity  in  rat  brain  regions.  In  conclusion,  this  study  clearly  shows  the  antiamnesic  effect  of ethanolic extract of Bambusa arundinacea leaves which may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-AChE  effects.    Though  the  exact  mechanism  for  antioxidant  and  AChE inhibition  by  EEBA  is  not known  but  it  can  be  attributed  to  the  presence  of  various  phytoconstituents  as  revealed  in  our preliminary  investigation.  However,  further  investigations  are  warranted  to  evaluate  the  exact mechanism of neuroprotective effect of EEBA and the phytoconstituents responsible for the observed effects.

				Anticonvulsants are a diverse group of pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. The goal of an anticonvulsant is to suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons that start a seizure. The use of current antiepileptic drugs has been questioned due to the non selectivity of the drugs and the undesirable side effects posed by them. This lead to the search for antiepileptic compounds with more selective activity and lower toxicity continues to be an area of investigation in medicinal chemistry. Semicarbazones are compounds which are synthesized by the condensation of semicarbazide and aldehydes/ketones. The literature survey revealed that semicarbazones had been emerged as a compound with broad range of activities including anticonvulsant, antitubercular, anticancer and antimicrobial activity. In this review chemistry and anticonvulsant activity of semicarbazone analogues are discussed.

				Purpose: To investigate the effect of amitriptyline (Ami) and sertraline (Sert) in diabetes neuropathy. Methods: Diabetes was induced in 3 groups of rats (n=6) with streptozotocin (STZ, 55mg/kg, i.p.). Two of the groups of diabetic rats received amitriptyline (15 mg/kg, p.o) and sertraline (30 mg/kg, p.o.) while another 2 groups (n=6) received the same drug treatment without prior administration of STZ. A normal group (n=6) of rats and STZ-induced group (n=6) of diabetic rats served as controls. The blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), pain sensitivity and neuromuscular strength in all the rats were determined. Results: Ami (15mg/kg, p.o.) produced severe hyperglycemia (p < 0.01) whereas Sert (30mg/kg, p.o.) produced significant hypoglycaemia in the diabetic rats. Ami significantly increased the GHb% level while Sert had no significant effect. Both Ami and Sert raised the grip strength that was significantly reduced by STZ. When administered for 3 weeks, Ami and Sert increased the STZ induced reduction of the grip strength in the diabetic rats (p< 0.01). STZ (55mg/kg, i.p) increased the pain sensitivity. Pain sensitivity was significantly reduced by Ami (15 mg/kg, p.o, administered for 3 weeks) in the diabetic rats but marginally reduced in the normal group. However 3-week administration of Sert (30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the pain sensitivity in both the diabetic and normal rats (p < 0.01) when compared with STZ treated group. Conclusion: Sertraline could offer a good choice in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy particularly in patients with depression being treated with amitriptyline.
